Files in this respository contain the necessary files to both create a CNN model for Image classification based on graphed signal images of EEG's collected from ALzheimer's and control (healthy) patients, AND the files for a random forest classifier of EEG signals for ALzheimer's and Non-alzheimer's patients. This Repository will also contain the necessary files and code to transform this dataset into a Graph dataset and eventually a GNN for classification of Alzheimer's/non-Alzheimer's.

Please ensure that all filepaths are correct when running the included code as it has not been optimized for outsider use
